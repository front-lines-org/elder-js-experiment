    <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>The <strong>northeastern Ukraine campaign</strong> was a theatre of operation from 24 February to 8 April 2022 in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine for control of two provinces (oblasts) in Ukraine — Chernihiv Oblast and Sumy Oblast. On 4 April 2022, Ukrainian authorities said that Russian troops had mostly withdrawn from Sumy Oblast and no longer occupied any towns or villages in the area. Later that evening Ukrainian authorities claimed that Russian forces had withdrawn from Chernihiv Oblast, which was confirmed by the Pentagon by 6 April. In addition, it took place from February 24th to May 14th in Kharkiv Oblast. On 14 May, the ISW reported that: “Ukraine thus appears to have won the battle of Kharkiv.” The Mayor of Kharkiv said to the BBC: "There was no shelling in the city for the last five days. There was only one attempt from Russians to hit the city with a missile rocket near Kharkiv airport, but the missile was eliminated by Ukrainian Air Defence."</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The northeastern Ukraine offensive was a major thrust by Russian armed forces on February 24, 2022, into Chernihiv and Sumy oblasts and their administrative capitals—Chernihiv and Sumy. Chernihiv was under siege for more than five weeks. The Ukrainians lost a battle for control of Sumy Oblast's second city, Konotop, 90 kilometers from the Russian border, on 25 February. A separate advance into Sumy Oblast the same day attacked the city of Sumy, just 35 km from the Russo-Ukrainian border. The Russian advance bogged down in urban fighting, and Ukrainian forces successfully held the city. According to Ukrainian sources, more than 100 Russian armoured vehicles were destroyed and dozens of soldiers were captured. Russian forces also attacked Okhtyrka, deploying thermobaric weapons.</p>
<p>While the battle of Sumy raged, Russian forces moved west along highways from Sumy, reaching Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March. In an assessment of the campaign on 4 March, Frederick Kagan wrote that the "Sumy axis is currently the most successful and dangerous Russian avenue of advance on Kyiv." He noted that the geography favored mechanized advances as the terrain "is flat and sparsely populated, offering few good defensive positions."</p>
<p>According to the Institute for the Study of War, since Russian forces failed to secure any new territory in the theater after 8 March, it is possible that they redeployed forces from eastern Kyiv to defend against Ukrainian counterattacks in Sumy Oblast.</p>
<p>On 2 April 2022 all of Kyiv Oblast, including Brovary, was declared free of invaders by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense after Russian troops left the area. On 4 April 2022 Russian troops had mostly withdrawn from Sumy Oblast and no longer occupied any towns or villages in the area. Later in the day Ukrainian authorities said Russian troops had also withdrawn from Chernihiv Oblast. The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast, but Sumy Oblast remained contested. On 7 April, Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy Oblast, said that all Russian troops had left the region, but the territory was still unsafe due to rigged explosives and other ammunition Russian troops had left behind.</p>
<p>On 14 May, the ISW reported that “Ukraine thus appears to have won the battle of Kharkiv.” The Mayor of Kharkiv said to the BBC: "There was no shelling in the city for the last five days. There was only one attempt from Russians to hit the city with a missile rocket near Kharkiv airport, but the missile was eliminated by Ukrainian Air Defence."</p>

<p>The ISW described a Ukrainian counteroffensive "along a broad arc" near Kharkiv, reporting that Ukraine had recaptured "several villages," including Tsyrkuny, Peremoha and part of Cherkaski Tyshky. The ISW also reported that Ukraine "may successfully push Russian forces out of artillery range in Kharkiv in the coming days."</p>
<h4 id="7-may">7 May</h4>
<p>It was reported that Ukrainian forces had successfully pushed back Russian forces stationed around Kharkiv, with the city getting further out of range for Russian forces. The same day, Ukrainian forces also reported retaking five villages northeast of Kharkiv. Quoting a Ukrainian official, <em>The New York Times</em> said that the battle for Kharkiv was not over, but that at the moment, Ukraine was dominating, and that Russian troops were destroying bridges as they were retreating.</p>
<h4 id="11-may">11 May</h4>
<p>Ukrainian forces claimed to have recaptured four settlements. This counteroffensive, if successful, could bring Ukrainian forces within several kilometers of the Russian border.</p>
<h4 id="13-may">13 May</h4>
<p>It was reported that Russia had decided to withdraw its forces from the Kharkiv Oblast.</p>
<h4 id="14-may">14 May</h4>
<p>The ISW reports that: “Ukraine thus appears to have won the battle of Kharkiv.” The Mayor of Kharkiv said to the BBC: "There was no shelling in the city for the last five days. There was only one attempt from Russians to hit the city with a missile rocket near Kharkiv airport, but the missile was eliminated by Ukrainian Air Defence."</p>
<h3 id="russian-counter-attack-and-continued-fighting">Russian counter-attack and continued fighting</h3>
<p>After the Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russian forces were driven back to defensive positions, some of which were within miles of the Russia-Ukraine international border. Despite this, they continued to shell various Kharkiv suburbs, as well as the city proper, killing numerous civilians and wounding dozens more. Skirmishes along the Russia–Ukraine border in the area of northeastern Ukraine continued between Russian and Ukrainian forces beyond 14 May.</p>
<h4 id="20-may">20 May</h4>
<p>Russian forces again shelled several villages in the Kharkiv district, including the city of Kharkiv itself, using BM-21 Grad, BM-27 Uragan and BM-30 Smerch multiple rocket launchers.</p>
<h4 id="21-may">21 May</h4>
<p>On 21 May, in a statement the Ukrainian police confirmed the recovery of the bodies of six military officials, including a Russian colonel, in the settlement of Zolochiv.</p>
<h4 id="22-may">22 May</h4>
<p>Russian forces made minimal progress in eastern Ukraine. New reports have confirmed that Russian troops had previously occupied Rubizhne in the northern Kharkiv Oblast on May 19. Russian forces have brought in additional reinforcements to maintain their positions on the west bank of the Seversky Donets River in northern Kharkov - instead of retreating across the river to use it as a defensive position - to prevent any further advance by Ukraine north or east that could to jeopardize Russian lines of communication along the Izium axis.</p>
<h4 id="24-may">24 May</h4>
<p>Russian forces attempted to retake Ternova in northern Kharkiv Oblast.</p>
<h4 id="6-july">6 July</h4>
<p>The Russian defence ministry claimed that a Russian airstrike on a "temporary deployment point" of Ukraine's 22nd Motorized Infantry Battalion "destroyed up to 100 Ukrainian nationalists and 4 pieces of military equipment."</p>
<h4 id="13-august">13 August</h4>
<p>Starting on August 13, Russian forces captured the town of Udy, northeast of Kharkiv. They attempted to push further, and fierce battles occurred in Zolochiv on August 19 and 20, with Ukrainian forces repulsing the attack.</p>
<h3 id="september-end-of-the-campaign">September: End of the campaign</h3>
<p>Beginning on September 6, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast, successfully recapturing approximately 2,500 square kilometers of territory, including the cities of Izium, Balakliia, and Kupiansk. The Russian Ministry of Defense then formally announced Russian forces' withdrawal from the majority of Kharkiv Oblast on September 11, with Russia only controlling parts of the region on the east bank of the Oskil River.</p>
