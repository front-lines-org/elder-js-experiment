    <!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>On 8 October 2022, at 6:07 a.m., a fire broke out on the Crimean Bridge as a result of an explosion, which occurred on the road part of the bridge from the side of the Taman Peninsula from the Crimean side. The fire spread to the railway part of the bridge and caused the partial collapse of the road spans into the water. At least three people have died as a result of the fire. In response to the explosion, a criminal investigation was initiated by the Investigative Committee of Russia.</p>
<p>The partial damage to the bridge reduced its transport capacity. The bridge is also being used to supply Russian troops in the occupied Crimea. The explosion occurred the day after the 70th birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin and two days after the announcement of the annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Russia. Ukrainian officials and the military have repeatedly declared their intention to destroy the Crimean Bridge, considering it to be a legitimate military target.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The bridge linking Crimea and Kuban began construction in February 2016, after the Russian occupation and annexation of the peninsula. The Russian authorities called the construction of the bridge a "historic mission", one of the key tasks for the "final unification of Crimea with Russia". In May 2018, the road bridge was opened to traffic, and in December 2019, the rail bridge became operational.</p>
<p>During the 2022 Russian invasion, the bridge was used to supply the Russian Armed Forces in the southern theater of operations. While other methods of supplying resources to Crimea exist, including ports, the bridge is still an important part of the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials and the military have repeatedly declared their intention to destroy the Crimean Bridge, considering it as a legitimate military target. Thus, in August 2022, an adviser to the presidential office, Mykhailo Podolyak, said in an interview with <em>The Guardian</em>: "It's an illegal construction and the main gateway to supply the Russian army in Crimea. Such objects should be destroyed". Major General of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Dmytro Marchenko stated that the bridge would become "target number one" as soon as Ukraine had weapons to attack it.</p>
<h2 id="event">Event</h2>
<p>On 8 October 2022, an explosion occurred on the road part of the Crimean Bridge, in the direction of travel from the Taman Peninsula towards Kerch. The press service of the Crimea Railway stated that at 6:05 am the equipment showed an error on the railway tracks on the railway part of the bridge, and a fuel container wagon caught fire in the tail of the freight train. As a result of the explosion, Crimea-bound spans of the roadway collapsed into the water, and road and rail traffic were stopped.</p>
<p>Initially, two possible causes of the fire were announced: the explosion of a fuel container wagon on the railway part of the bridge and the explosion of an automotive vehicle, probably a truck, on the road part. According to the of the Russian Federation, a truck was blown up, which caused the fire of seven rail fuel containers.</p>
<p>Though no one claimed responsibility for the explosion, the Ukrainian media <em>Ukrainska Pravda</em> and UNIAN, citing their own sources, stated that it was a Security Service of Ukraine operation.</p>
<p>Later in the day the bridge reopened to light road traffic on one carriageway and some rail traffic.</p>
<h2 id="impacts">Impacts</h2>
<h3 id="casualties">Casualties</h3>
<p>According to the Investigative Committee of Russia, three people died as a result of the explosion, including a man and woman in a car driving next to the exploded truck.</p>
<h3 id="losses-of-goods">Losses of goods</h3>
<p>Seven fuel tankers of a 59-wagon train destined for the Crimean Peninsula caught on fire due to the explosion.</p>
<h3 id="structural-damage">Structural damage</h3>
<p>A Maxar satellite image showed that three spans of the roadway deck on the Crimea-bound side had collapsed. In videos and satellite imagery, there was considerable discolouration and deformation of girders of the rail bridge.</p>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<h3 id="ukrainian">Ukrainian</h3>
<p>The Ukrainian government's official Twitter account tweeted "sick burn" in response to the fire, while Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential advisor, called the damage the "beginning": "Crimea, a bridge, the beginning. Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine compared the destruction of the Crimean Bridge to the sinking of the cruiser <strong>Moskva</strong> writing: "The guided missile cruiser Moskva and the Kerch Bridge – two notorious symbols of Russian power in Ukrainian Crimea – have gone down. What's next in line, Russkies?".</p>
<p>Director of Ukrposhta Ihor Smilianskyi announced the release of a new stamp set dedicated to the event.</p>
<p>Oleksiy Danilov, head of the National Security and Defence Council, posted a video of the bridge on social media, along with a video of Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" to US President John F. Kennedy. The explosion occurred a day after the birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said during his nightly address: "Today was not a bad day and mostly sunny on our state's territory. Unfortunately, it was cloudy in Crimea. Although it was also warm."</p>
<h3 id="russian">Russian</h3>
<p>The Russian occupation authorities of the Crimea accused the Ukrainian side. The spokeswoman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Maria Zakharova, accused the "Kyiv regime" of terrorism, and a deputy of the State Duma, Andrey Gurulyov (United Russia), called on the commander-in-chief to "strongly respond". In April 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, former President and Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of Russia, said: "One of the Ukrainian generals talked about the need to strike at the Crimean Bridge. I hope he understands what the retaliatory target will be."</p>
<p>Sergey Aksyonov, the Russian appointed head of Crimea, has indicated that they have enough food and fuel saying: "The situation is manageable - it's unpleasant, but not fatal". He also expressed a desire for revenge.</p>
<p>On the night from 8 to 9 October, Russian forces launched rockets at residential buildings in Zaporizhzhia, killing at least twenty people.</p>
<h3 id="international">International</h3>
<p>The foreign minister of Estonia, Urmas Reinsalu, welcomed the explosion and suggested that Ukrainian special forces were behind it, recalling that the Ukrainian authorities had long called the Crimean Bridge a possible target for a strike.</p>
<p>Member of the European Parliament from Poland, Robert Biedroń (New Left) said: "A balm for the heart, especially since yesterday was Putin's birthday. It's good that Putin received such a gift. I hope he gets more. Ukrainians are destroying Russia's illegal infrastructure [in the occupied Crimea]".</p>
<p>Jaroslav Naď, the Slovak Minister of Defence, joked in an official Facebook post about the explosions having been caused by too many candles on Putin's birthday cake.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Transport of Russia announced that the ferry service across the Kerch Strait, which operated before the construction of the Crimean bridge, was being re-launched. Crimea initially imposed restrictions on the sale of groceries and fuel. Two hours later, it was announced that restrictions were lifted in Sevastopol.</p>
<p>The Crimean Bridge is an important part of the transport connection between Russia and Crimea for the southern theater of operations of the Russo-Ukrainian War. It is expected that the partial destruction of the Crimean Bridge will lead to increased problems with the supply of Russian troops in occupied Crimea and in the entire southern part of Ukraine. In addition, with the closure of the bridge, it becomes more difficult for local residents to leave Crimea, although other ways remain, including ports.</p>
<p>The symbolic nature of the destruction is no less important for the Kremlin. The opening of the bridge in 2018 was considered one of Putin's greatest achievements. After the Russian invasion of 2022, the structure was one of the most protected objects. A week before the explosion, a decree was signed on the annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Russia, after which Russia continued to threaten Ukraine with nuclear weapons in the event of an attack on objects in the annexed territories.</p>
<p>On 8 October, the Russian foreign ministry published a video showing that the bridge was partially reopened to light vehicles. Trucks must take the ferry while trains have resumed according Russian state media. President Putin has ordered the security of the bridge to be placed under the control of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). The Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Marat Khusnullin has said that the damaged portions of the bridge will be taken down and repairs are to commence immediately. On 9 October, it is planned that divers will check on the bridge for any underwater damage.</p>
<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>
<p>By order of Putin, a special commission was created to investigate the circumstances of the explosion, including representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry of Transport, the FSB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the National Guard. The Investigative Committee opened a criminal investigation into the explosion. Representatives of the special services drew attention to the shift that failed to detect the truck with explosives, despite the complexes installed at the entrance to the bridge to watch for suspicious cargo.</p>
<p>The National Anti-Terrorism Committee of Russia has reported:</p>
<p>"At 06:07 Moscow time today [03:07 GMT], an explosion was set off at a cargo vehicle on the motorway part of the Crimean bridge on the side of the Taman peninsula, which set fire to seven fuel tanks of a train that was en route to the Crimean peninsula. Two motorway sections of the bridge partially collapsed."</p>
